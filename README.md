# VisioLaser
A laser displays patterns defined by points, and a camera records how the pattern is displayed.

# Note:

1- When running the code, you must run the servo motor code in parallel with the camera code.

2- In our example of a triangle display, we used 3 points and returned to the first point. You can certainly modify this.
